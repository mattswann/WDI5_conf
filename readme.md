# WDIConf is REAL(TM)

From humble begginings in old factory turned co-working spaces to just empty spaces with potentially uncomfortable chairs.

WDIConf is where 200 means success and 418 is a teapot.

That will allow attendees to view and book a seat(s) at any of the planned presentations at the conference held at GA Melbourne.

### Requirements

- Location and conference information
- Timetable and title of presentations/talks
